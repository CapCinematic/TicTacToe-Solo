# TicTacToe-Solo

Overview of my project and goals:

## Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:

- DRY JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Work on and develope more problem solving skills.

# Technologies used:
I created this Tic-Tac-Toe board using a Macbook Pro (2022) with the VS Code text editor.
I used Trello to organize my iterations and hold all links necessary to help me make my way through this project.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Architecture:

My application consist of one HTML file one CSS file and three JavaScript files:

- A player.js file that contains a Player class.

Player methods include, but are not limited to:
A constructor - properties should include: id (ex: 'one'), token (ex:'⭐️'), wins (ex: 0)
An increaseWins function - increases the count of the player’s wins

- A game.js file that contains a Game class.

Game Class includes:

Two Player instances
A way to keep track of the data for the game board
A way to keep track of which player’s turn it currently is
A way to check the Game’s board data for win conditions
A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)
A way to reset the Game’s board to begin a new game

- A main.js file that contains all DOM related JavaScript
  Running several functions and query selecting sections of my HTML to connect data to the Dom.

# Future features:

- Philosophical Quote Display
- Music
- Local Storage
   
- Wins/Challenges:

- I worked through a few challenges. In my planning stage I decided on the idea to use an array of winning combantions arrays. Implementing the function and adjusting the logic proved to take up quite a bit of time. After connecting with Will Mitchell(Director of Front End Engineering) on a zoom call I was able to find some clarity. 

- I learned a lot about event delegation and function placement especially while updating the DOM.

- A goal of mine was to practice with CSS selectors I haven't used before. This project I got to implement border radius, box-shadows and background images using a linear-gradient.

- Overall win was that I completed the project and I'm proud of how it came out.
